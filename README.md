``` 
Window -> Package Manager -> + sign -> Add via git url:

https://github.com/BoundfoxStudios/fluentassertions-unity.git#upm 
```

## Things to add/do
- Q learning
- NEAT algorithm
- visualise fitness of generations over time
- visualise the network itself
- add new tracks
- experiment with changing the fitness function
